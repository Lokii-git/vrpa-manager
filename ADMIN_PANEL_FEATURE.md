# Admin Panel Feature

## Overview
Added a complete admin panel for managing users (team members) in the vRPA Management application.

## What's New

### Components Created

1. **UserForm.tsx** (`src/components/UserForm.tsx`)
   - Dialog-based form for adding and editing users
   - Fields: Name and Email
   - Email validation
   - Can be used for both creating new users and editing existing ones
   - Toast notifications for success/error feedback

2. **AdminPanel.tsx** (`src/components/AdminPanel.tsx`)
   - Full admin interface for user management
   - Displays total user count
   - Table view of all team members
   - Actions: Add, Edit, and Remove users
   - Confirmation dialog for user removal
   - Empty state with call-to-action

### Hook Updates

**use-vrpa.ts** - Added three new functions:
- `addTeamMember(memberData)` - Add a new team member
- `updateTeamMember(memberId, updates)` - Update existing team member
- `removeTeamMember(memberId)` - Remove a team member

### App Integration

**App.tsx** - Added new "Admin" tab:
- New tab in the main navigation (5th tab)
- Icon: UserGear
- Full integration with the admin panel component
- Uses local state management (persists via KV store)

## How to Use

1. **Access Admin Panel**: Click the "Admin" tab in the main navigation
2. **Add User**: Click "Add User" button, fill in name and email
3. **Edit User**: Click "Edit" next to any user in the table
4. **Remove User**: Click "Remove" and confirm the action

## Features

- ✅ Local-only storage (no backend required)
- ✅ Data persists across sessions (KV store)
- ✅ Form validation (required fields, email format)
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- ✅ Toast notifications for user feedback
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Empty states with helpful CTAs
- ✅ Clean, modern UI matching the existing design

## Technical Details

- **State Management**: Uses existing `useKV` hook from Spark
- **Storage Key**: `team-members` (already in use)
- **ID Generation**: Uses existing `generateId()` utility
- **UI Components**: Uses shadcn/ui components (Dialog, Table, AlertDialog, etc.)
- **Icons**: Phosphor Icons React library

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add role-based access control (Admin, User roles)
- Add user avatar uploads
- Add bulk user import/export
- Add user activity logs
- Integrate with backend authentication system
